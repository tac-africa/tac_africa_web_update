The academy has established the world's first drone corridor, which provides a technologically friendly environment for local and international drone companies to test their solutions.", "South Africa was one of the first countries to enact comprehensive drone regulations, establishing the country as a global leader in this field. Since then, other countries have followed suit. The South African SME institute offers the 4IRI Drone Academy, the first drone school to provide businesses with custom-made mission rehearsals to assess risks and prepare for effective flights. Drone practical training is available at the RPAS Training Academy in Durban, the Drone Academy, and the Starlite Aviation Group. The Feenix Drone Academy in Cape Town offers advanced drone pilot training, while the Flight School and NTSU Drone Academy both provide specialized drone training. Training South Africa also provides drone operation courses.", "Morocco will be the first African country to produce drones. In recent years, it has increased its imports of drones, in part due to ongoing tensions with Algeria and the Western Sahara, which Morocco considers to be part of its territory. The country has reached an agreement with Israeli defense firms to construct two factories to manufacture low-cost drones. Drone training is provided by Morocco Flying Labs and the Morocco Aerospace Institute, while drone services are provided by Drone Morocco.",

            'Agricultural Application In Agriculture, drones offers farmers affordable and effective methods to monitor crops. Drones equipped with infrared sensors are especially helpful to monitor crop health, giving farmers faster and reliable information to take precautionary measures to improve the crop conditions and yield. According to estimates, drone technology will cover 80% of the agriculture industry in the coming few years.', 'Terrain Mapping Scientists and researchers use drones fitted with LIDAR sensors and 3D cameras to capture 3D imagery of terrains for terrain mapping. The AI-powered drones are pre-programmed to fly over a defined course without any need for human intervention. The drone can either store recording onboard or sent live video/images to the ground stations for further processes. This application of the drone is especially useful to create powerful and precise Digital Elevation Models (DEM) of terrains, which subsequently is used in a variety of scientific researches including remote sensing and GIS.', 'Livestock Management Apart from agricultural management, drones are now being used for livestock management as well. The AI-powered drones can be pre-programmed to monitor and track livestock in the fields, giving ranchers real-time aerial view of the livestock for better management and monitoring of livestock. Thermal sensors equipped drones are also used for nighttime surveillance of livestock and identification of any issues in real-time.'
